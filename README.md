# Dashboard in Power BI

### History Sales Report: Video Game Industry

**Objective:** The aim of this report is to illustrate the sales evolution within the video game industry, showcasing key insights such as sales by year, platform, and game genre.

### Process of Creating the Report:

To craft the dashboard, the initial step was to upload the dataset into Power BI.

Following this, I proceeded to utilize the Query Editor to prepare the data, which included tasks such as removing an unnecessary column, adjusting data types, and refining values.

Once the data was prepared, I embarked on creating a diverse array of visualizations, comprising a graphical circle, stacked bar charts, a stacked column chart, a table, and a card.

Additionally, to enrich the user experience and facilitate deeper interaction, data segmentations were incorporated into the dashboard.

Note: This project was undertaken as part of a course on Udemy titled "Curso Power BI – Análisis de Datos y Business Intelligence" by Javier Gomez.
